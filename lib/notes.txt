when user joins a room he gets an access code:
    - he joins socket channel at room/<id>/channel
    - if he has the right code he is accepted to join this room
    - then he sends his data over the socket
    - the room host uses this data to add him to the room
    - ONLY THE HOST CAN BROADCAST MESSAGES TO ALL THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS
