One User Open the app and creates a new room:   
    1- The Server runs serving this room. 
    2- The room host joins this room. 
    3- when anyone wants to join this room a code is generated for him/her. 
    4- he should send post request to host/rooms/:roomId with this code. 
    5- the host decides whether this person should join or not.
    6- when somebody (not the host) wants to send the file he should send request to rooms/:roomId/send-file.
    7- the file is added to the room files and then the host notifies all users about the new file.

When a user wants to join a room (not his):
    1- a code generated for him and sent to the host host/rooms/:roomId.
    2- when the host accepts this request all users get notified about this user.

when a user wants to download a file he downloads it from the original owner of this file (not the host).
